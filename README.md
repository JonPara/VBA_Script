* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

   * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

   * The total Volume of the stock

   * Ticker symbol

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
